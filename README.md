## ðŸ’¡ Contributing your own Module


If you would like to contribute your own module to BisQue, please use the BQModule Generator CLI we developed to automate the module generation process. You mainly need your source code in a `src` folder and the documentation will guide you through the rest of the way. 

> __TIP:__ Double check that you do not have hard coded paths! This is a common issue amongst first time module creators.
